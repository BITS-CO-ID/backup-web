To whom it may concern

Sequel to your non response of our earlier letter to you on behalf of the trustees and executors to the Will of our late client. I wish to notify you that you are a beneficiary to the total sum of Twenty Three Million Four hundred thousand Great British Pounds in the codicil and last testament of the deceased.

All the legal papers will be processed on your response. We request that you kindly forward any proof of identities of yours, your current telephone and fax numbers and forwarding address to enable us file necessary documents at our high court probate division for the release of the money.

Look forward to your urgent response and our partnership.

Sincerely,

Barrister N. West
