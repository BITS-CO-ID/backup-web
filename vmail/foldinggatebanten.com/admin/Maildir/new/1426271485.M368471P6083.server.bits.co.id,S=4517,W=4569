Before I proceed, I must first apologize for this unsolicited letter to you. I am aware that this is certainly not a conventional way of approach to establish a relationship of trust, but you will realize the need for my action.
 
In a brief introduction, I am Alex Fernando Ferris, the Director of Operation with LA CAIXA BANK, MADRID-SPAIN. I have a very interesting transaction to discuss with you. 
The business under discussion has to do with (Artur Popov) from Russia, who is a Consultant/ Oil contractor with (GAZPROM OIL COMPANY RUSSIA) 

I managed to get your contact details through the Internet search myself because time is of importance to it and I am desperately looking for a person to assist me to pull this money out from the bank before our corrupt government officials will confiscate the money.
 
On Wednesday, July  4, 2012, Artur Popov, was involved in Air-Crash near the city of (lensk) in Russian suburb. For more clarifications, you can visit the CNN web news for the tragedy.
http/www.4july 2012,helicopter accident/Utair/crashed.
Since then I have made several inquiries to Russia Embassy, in a bid to locate any relation of Artur Popov. All attempts to reach the next of kin of Artur Popov has been futile as He had no family here in Spain. Hence my decision to contact you. I want you and I to go into partnership, the nature of your business is completely irrelevant to this transaction as all I need from you is an assurance that my interest will be fully protected once this transaction is concluded.

Artur Popov, made a numbered time (fixed) deposited for fourty eight  calendar and his account with our Bank accrues to about (Fourteen Million, Three hundred Thousand Euros ) €14.3M. According to the Spanish Law, at the expiration of Four and half years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Spanish government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Artur Popov so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials who will latter use the money to sponsor  there personal interest in the search for political power/seat.
 
Please Note: There will be no problem at all, my position as the Director of Operation guarantees the successful execution of this transaction within 7 Banking days and the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 40% for you and 50% for me, 10% for any miscellaneous expenses. 
This is very simple, I will like you to reply immediately so that I can send you the Text of application which you will fill and apply to the bank as the next of kin to Artur Popov and I will use my good position in the bank as the Director of Operation to make sure that the application is approved, during board meeting for immediate payment.
 
Please reply immediately via my alternative mail address stated above. Please send me your private phone, or mobile numbers for easier correspondence by our foreign solicitor. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
Best regards,
Mr. Alex Fernando Ferris.
(Director Of Operation)
